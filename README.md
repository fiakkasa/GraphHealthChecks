## Note

There appears to be a compatibility issue for projects targeting .NET 7 and assembly
`Assembly Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting, Version=7.0.0.0` and more specifically
`OptionsBuilderExtensions.ValidateOnStart` resulting in error:

> The call is ambiguous between the following methods or properties:
> ```csharp
> Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.OptionsBuilderExtensions.ValidateOnStart<TOptions>(Microsoft.Extensions.Options.OptionsBuilder<TOptions>)
> ```

Until resolved please consider using a version of the package targeting .NET 7.

## Usage

Locate the services registration and append one of:

- `.AddGraphHealthWithNoLogger` - use when no logging is required
- `.AddGraphHealthWithILogger` - use when the ILogger provider is available
- `.AddGraphHealthWithILoggerFactory` - use when the ILoggerFactory provider is available

‚ö†Ô∏è Bear in mind that `IHealthChecksBuilder` needs to be appended before any of the aforementioned.

ex.

```csharp
// Startup.cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // ...
    services
        .AddHealthChecks()
        .AddGraphHealthWithILogger();
    // ...
}
```

üìù If further customization is required, consider wiring up any of the factories manually or use the `GraphHealthCheck`
class itself as required.

If separate schemas are present, multiple registrations can be done for each schema.

ex.

```csharp
// Startup.cs
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    // ...
    services
        .AddHealthChecks()
        .AddGraphHealthWithILogger(healthName: "health1", schemaName: "schema1")
        .AddGraphHealthWithILogger(healthName: "health2", schemaName: "schema2");
    // ...
}
```
